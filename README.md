# Applications
- Solid mechanics with the simulation of the brain, the ear, the bones, the heart, the liver,
- Fluid dynamics with the simulation of fat filling and blood flow in aneurysms,
- Thermodynamics with thermo-ablation of tumors,
- and many other topics as image processing, animation or biological applications !
