# Applications
- Solid mechanics with the simulation of the brain, the ear, the bones, the heart, and liver.
- Fluid dynamics with the simulation of fat filling and blood flow in aneurysms.
- Thermodynamics with thermo-ablation of tumors.
- and many other topics as image processing, animation or biological applications.
